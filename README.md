# Boardclip

Boardclip is a cross-platform/multi-platform shared clipboard application to transfer data such as text between two or more computing devices. Cut, copy, or paste text from one device to another, whether it be a virtual machine-host, or client-server.

# Quickstart

* Download the client or clients compatible with your operating system, located in Releases. Generally, two clients may be needed in order to transfer clipboard data from one system to another.
* Unzip the folder and run the executable.
* In the Client tab, select the server number in the dropdown. A status should display in the console indicating if the server is available.
* Finally, enter a unique identifier in the Id section, then hit Connect.  When a cut or copy is performed from the origin client, the destination client having the same Id should receive the text data.  The default base plan allows up to a character limit, and is increased over 10x with the pro version, including additional benefits.

# Support: Issues, Discussions, and Wiki
